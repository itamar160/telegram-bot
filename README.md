for the bot:
1 - import pyTelegramBotAPI
2 - run the bot
3 - the name is ImageHashbot


for the tester:
1 - import pyrogram
2- create a telegram app with: https://my.telegram.org/apps 
3 - put the api_id and api_hash into their corresponding variables 
4 - run the tester while the bot is running

** when you send an image as a photo the bot works but, couldn't get the bot to recognize any files, the api suggestion (content_types=['document']) didn't work
